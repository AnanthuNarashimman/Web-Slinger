# web-slinger 🕸️

**A comic-book-inspired personal portfolio**  
Built with React, pure CSS chaos, and a whole lot of web-slinging energy.

This is me, Ananthu Narashimman — full-stack developer, AI enthusiast, and self-proclaimed digital vigilante — reimagined as the hero (or menace?) of my own comic issue.

### What you're looking at:
- Yellowed comic-page aesthetic  
- Wanted posters  
- Tech arsenal trading cards  
- Pinned project panels  
- A timeline that reads like an origin story  
- One very dramatic contact splash page

### Current Status: **WORK IN PROGRESS** 🏗️
The site is live and fully functional, but a few things are still swinging in:

- Contact form & social links are not connected yet  
- Some buttons currently redirect to random/fake accounts (don’t @ them, they’re innocent)  
- More projects, easter eggs, and chaos coming soon

When it’s 100% done, every link will point to the real me. Until then — consider this Issue #1 (Collector’s Edition).

### Built with
- React + Vite  
- Pure CSS (no UI frameworks, all hand-rolled comic madness)  
- Love, caffeine, and way too many Spider-Man rewatches

Made with ❤️ (and a little bit of danger)  
— Ananthu (your friendly neighborhood developer)
